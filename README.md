# FigmaComponentInventory
One of the first steps to creating a design system for an existing product is understanding what are the pieces already in use. This project helps people to do that. 

# Directions
1. Download ComponentInventory.py
2. Call ComponentInventory.py, providing the file key as an argument 
  - For example, if the file key is "VpTF1TXP2HjtbVx3tHHTBsa1", call "python ComponentInventory.py VpTF1TXP2HjtbVx3tHHTBsa1" 
  - Also, I'm sure it's fine if you use my Figma API token, but you can replace it with yours in the file: "getimageurl.py"
